An adventure-based programming language, written in the style of Zork.

# About
ZorKode I: The Great Pythonic Dungeon is a Python-interpreted programming language meant to mimic the style of MS-DOS era text-based adventure games. The language tasks the programmer (Adventurer) to bravely make their way through a simple dungeon, collecting little bits and pieces of Python code along the way. Once you collect enough parts and make your way to the center of the dungeon, you can start piecing together your program one word (or line if you're clever enough) at a time. The fun of the program comes from runnning your code after every new piece of .zrk code written, seeing how the language reacts to your commands, and learning more about the world as you do.
